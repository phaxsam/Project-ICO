        Finless is a decentralized warehouse asset liquidity protocol developed
        to add value to the primary operations of warehouse financing globally.
        Protocol connects lenders and borrowers to unlock liquidity for their
        assets stored in warehouses and provide multi-level interest returns to
        lenders. Via a DApp on the Binance Smart Chain, the protocol enables a
        way to decentralize and optimize global warehousing("$950 Billion global
        markets estimated to reach $3.5 trillion by the end of 2028."). The
        native token for the project is the $FLES token. The $FLES tokens are
        used to reward users for participating in different operations on the
        protocol. Finless enables seamless interaction between the collateral
        manager, Asset owner, and lender in which the borrowers tokenize their
        assets and are stored as deposits in a warehouse. Asset tokenization
        mines warehouse receipts into collateralized Non-Fungible-Tokens(NFTs).
        Asset owners finance their assets by sending their collateralized NFTs
        into a DAO-enabled pool on the DApp. Lenders will receive BUSD in
        exchange for assets into the Pool. These tokens mature as the borrower's
        interest rate matures. Finless gives asset owners access to real-time
        liquidity from the blockchain as collateral to access financing.
        Borrowers of all categories, especially from developing countries with
        little or no access to liquidity for their assets, can now finance them
        without relying on inefficient and slow traditional financial services.
        Finless bridges warehouse asset to Defi. Borrowers can easily access
        liquidity on the protocol via the pool. Investors receive a return plus
        $FLES rewards. Finless is on Binance Smart Chain, due to subdued gas
        fees.
